NAME
----
git-difftool - stage changes using the standard git merge tools

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git difftool' [--tool=<tool>] [--ref=<ref>] [--no-prompt] [<file>]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'git-difftool' is a git command that allows you to compare and edit
files against arbitrary revisions using the standard git merge tools.

OPTIONS
-------

-t or --tool=<tool>::
	Use the merge resolution program specified by <tool>.
	Valid merge tools are:
	kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff
+
If a merge resolution program is not specified, 'git-difftool'
will use the configuration variable `merge.tool`.  If the
configuration variable `merge.tool` is not set, 'git-difftool'
will pick a suitable default.
+
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the
configuration variable `mergetool.<tool>.path`. For example, you
can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
`mergetool.kdiff3.path`. Otherwise, 'git-difftool' assumes the
tool is available in PATH.
+
Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs
'git-difftool' can be customized to run an alternative program
by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration
variable `mergetool.<tool>.cmd`.
+
When 'git-difftool' is invoked with this tool (either through the
`-t` or `--tool` option or the `merge.tool` configuration
variable) the configured command line will be invoked with 
with the following variables available: 'BASE' is the name of a
temporary file containing the contents of the file from the index.
'LOCAL' is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of
the file as it appears in the work tree; 'REMOTE' is the name of a
temporary file containing the contents of the file from the reference
being merged; 'MERGED' contains the name of the file to which the
merge tool should write the results of a successful merge.
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of
the index; `$LOCAL` set to the name of a temporary file containing
the contents of the file as it appears in the work tree;
`$REMOTE` set to the name of a temporary file containing the
contents of the file to be merged, and `$MERGED` set to the name
of the file to which the merge tool should write the result of the
merge resolution.
+
If the custom merge tool correctly indicates the success of a
merge resolution with its exit code then the configuration
variable `mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode` can be set to `true`.
Otherwise, 'git-difftool' will prompt the user to indicate the
success of the resolution after the custom tool has exited.

-r or --ref=<ref>::
	Specifies a commit-ish reference to compare against.
	'git-difftool' compares against the index by default.

--no-prompt::
	Do not prompt before and after launching a merge tool.

CONFIG VARIABLES
----------------

merge.tool::
	The default merge tool to use.
+
See the `--tool=<tool>` option above for more details.

mergetool.<tool>.path::
	Override the path for the given tool.  This is useful in case
	your tool is not in the PATH.

mergetool.<tool>.cmd::
	Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool.
+
See the `--tool=<tool>` option above for more details.

mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode::
	For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of
	the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge was
	successful.  If this is not set to true then the merge target file
	timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been successful
	if the file has been updated, otherwise the user is prompted to
	indicate the success of the merge.

mergetool.keepBackup::
	After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers
	can be saved as a file with a `.orig` extension.  If this variable
	is set to `false` then this file is not preserved.  Defaults to
	`true` (i.e. keep the backup files).
