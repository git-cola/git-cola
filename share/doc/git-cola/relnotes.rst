  repository's private local `.git/info/exclude` ignore file.
  (`#1006 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1006>`_)
  (`#1000 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1000>`_)

* New remotes are now selected when they are added in the "Edit Remotes" tool.
  (`#1002 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1002>`_)

* The "Recent" repositories list is now saved to disk when opening a
  repository.  Previously, this list was only updated when exiting the app.
  (`#1001 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1001>`_)

* The bookmarks tool now has a "Delete" option in its right-click menu.
  (`#999 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/999>`_)

* The current repository is no longer listed in the "File/Open Recent" menu.
  (`#998 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/998>`_)

Translations
------------
* Updated Hungarian translation.
  (`#1005 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1005>`_)

* Updated Turkish translation.
  (`#1003 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/1003>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Fetch, push, and pull operations will now refresh the model and display when
  operations complete.
  (`#996 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/996>`_)

* The branches widget now refreshes its display when changing branches.
  (`#992 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/992>`_)

Packaging
---------

  updated during installation.
  (`#991 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/991>`_)

Development
-----------
* The unit tests were made more platform-independent.
  (`#993 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/993>`_)

.. _v3.5:

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Auto-completion for filenames can now be disabled.  This speeds up
  revision completion when working in large repositories with many files.
  (`#981 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/981>`_)

* The Stash dialog now shows the stash date as a tooltip when hovering
  over a stashed change.
  (`#982 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/982>`_)

* Qt HiDPI settings are overriden by the `git cola` HiDPI appearance settings.
  These overrides can now be disabled by selecting the "Disable" mode.
  This allows users to control Qt's HiDPI settings through environment
  variables.  Additionally, the "Auto" mode now detects the presence of
  the Qt HiDPI variables and no longer overrides them when the user has
  configured their environment explicitly.
  (`#963 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/963>`_)

* Confirmation dialogs can now focus buttons using the Tab key.
  Previously, the "Y" and "N" keys could be used to confirm or deny
  using the keyboard, but "Tab" is more familiar.
  (`#965 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/965>`_)

* Error dialogs (for example, when a commit hook fails) will now always
  show the details.  The details were previously hidden behind a toggle.
  (`#968 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/968>`_)

Translations
------------
* Updated Japanese translation.
  (`#973 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/973>`_)
  (`#974 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/974>`_)

* Updated Simplified Chinese translation.
  (`#950 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/950>`_)

Fixes
-----
* The filesystem monitor no longer logs that it has been enabled after the
  inotify watch limit is reached on Linux.
  (`#984 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/984>`_)

* Better unicode robustness.
  (`#990 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/990>`_)
  (`#910 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/991>`_)

* The "Branches" widget did not always update itself when deleting branches
  (for example, when inotify is disabled or unavailable).
  (`#978 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/978>`_)

* Non-ascii unicode byte strings are more robustly handled by the log widget.
  (`#977 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/977>`_)

* Non-unicode results from the `gettext` library are more robustly handled.
  (`#969 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/969>`_)

* Launching `git cola` from within a directory that has since been deleted
  would previously result in a traceback, and is now robustly handled.
  (`#961 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/961>`_)

Packaging
---------
* The vendored `qtpy` library was updated to `v1.9`.

.. _v3.4:

git-cola v3.4
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The file browser now includes "Blame" in its context menu.
  (`#953 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/953>`_)

* The "Push" action now uses "git push --force-with-lease" when using
  the "Force" option with Git v1.8.5 and newer.
  (`#946 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/946>`_)

* Updated German translation.
  (`#936 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/936>`_)

* The `Status` widget learned to optionally display file counts in its
  category headers, and indent the files displayed in each category.
  (`#931 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/931>`_)

* The `Branches` widget can now sort branches by their most recent commit.
  (`#930 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/930>`_)

* `git cola` now includes configurable GUI themes that can be used to style
  the user interface.  Enable the new themes by configuring `cola.theme`
  in the preferences window.  See the
  `cola.theme documentation <https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#cola-theme>`_
  for more details.  (`#924 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/924>`_)

* `git cola` now has built-in support for HiDPI displays by enabling
  Qt's 5.6's `QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR` feature.
  (`#938 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/938>`_)

* `git cola` now uses HiDPI pixmaps when rendering icons, and the builtin
  icons have been updated to look sharp when displayed in HiDPI.
  (`#932 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/932>`_)

Fixes
-----
* `git cola`'s "Revert Unstaged Edits" previously checked out from "HEAD^",
  when in "Amend" mode, and removing staged changes.  This behavior has been
  changed to always checkout from the index, which avoids data loss.
  (`#947 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/947>`_)

* `git cola` has been updated to work with newer versions of `gnome-terminal`
  and no longer shell-quotes its arguments when launching `gnome-terminal`.
  The `cola.terminalshellquote` configuration variable can be set to `true` to
  get the old behavior, or to handle other terminals that take the command to run
  as a single string instead of as arguments to `execv()`.
  (`#935 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/935>`_)

* `git dag` now properly handles arbitrary input on Python3.
  Previously, an exception would be raised when entering `--grep=xxx` where
  `xxx` is a quoted string with a missing end-quote.
  (`#941 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/941>`_)

Development
-----------
* The contribution guidelines for contributors has been updated to mention
  how to regenerate the `*.mo` message files.
  (`#934 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/934>`_)

.. _v3.3:

git-cola v3.3
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` improved how it renders parent commits.
  (`#921 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/921>`_)

* The `Branches` widget now checks out branches when double-clicked.
  (`#920 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/920>`_)

* The new `Submodules` widget makes it easy to interact with submodules.
  Additionally, submodules can now be updated using the `Status` widget.
  (`#916 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/916>`_)

* Updated Japanese translation.
  (`#914 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/914>`_)

* The "Open Terminal" action now launches a Git Bash shell on Windows.
  (`#913 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/913>`_)

* New menu actions for updating all submodules.
  (`#911 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/911>`_)

* The status widget can now update submodules.
  (`#911 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/911>`_)

* The "Apply Patch" `git cola am` dialog now includes a diff viewer
  to display the contents of the selected patch.

* The "Alt+D" diffstat hotkey now selects the staged/modified/etc.
  header in the Status widget, which shows the totality of everything
  that will be committed.
  (`#771 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/771>`_)

* Running "Launch Editor" from the diff editor now opens the editor at the
  current line.
  (`#898 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/898>`_)

* The textwidth and tabwidth configuration values can now be set
  per-repository, rather than globally only.

* Text entry widgets switched to using a block cursor in `v3.2`.
  This has been reverted to the original line cursor for consistency
  with other applications and user expectations.
  (`#889 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/889>`_)

* The "edit at line" feature, used by the "Grep" tool, now supports
  the Sublime text editor.
  (`#894 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/894>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Launching external programs has been improved on Windows.
  (`#925 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/925>`_)

* Improve compatibility when using PySide2.
  (`#912 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/912>`_)

* The Diff Editor was not honoring the configured tab width on startup.
  (`#900 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/900>`_)

* The "Delete Files" feature was creating an unreadable display when
  many files were selected.  Word-wrap the list of files so that the
  display stays within a sensible size.
  (`#895 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/895>`_)

* Spelling and grammar fixes.
  (`#915 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/915>`_)
  (`#891 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/891>`_)

Development
-----------
* The logo was run through `tidy` to give it a consistent style.
  Some technical issues with the logo were improved.
  (`#877 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/877>`_)

* The entire codebase is now checked by `flake8`, rather than just
  the module and test directories.  This catches things like
  the pynsist installer scripts.
  (`#884 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/884>`_)
  (`#882 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/882>`_)
  (`#879 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/879>`_)

Packaging
---------
* The vendored `qtpy` library was updated to `v1.6`.

* The Windows installer's wrapper scripts were missing an import.
  (`#878 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/878>`_)

.. _v3.2:

git-cola v3.2
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The `git cola dag` DAG window now supports `git revert`.
  (`#843 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/843>`_)

* `git stash pop` is now supported by the stash dialog.
  (`#844 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/844>`_)

* The status widget now ensures that each item is visible when selection
  changes.  Previously, if you scrolled to the right to see the name of
  a long filename, and then selected a short filename above it, the widget
  may not have shown the short filename in the viewport.  We now ensure
  that the filenames are visible when the selection changes.
  (`#828 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/828>`_)

* The `git xbase` rebase editor no longer displays an error when
  cancelling an interactive rebase.
  (`#814 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/814>`_)

* The dialog shown when renaming remotes has been simplified.
  (`#840 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/840>`_)
  (`#838 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/838>`_)

* The help dialog in the `git-xbase` Rebase editor is now scrollable.
  (`#855 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/855>`_)

Translations
------------
* Updated Brazilian translation.
  (`#845 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/845>`_)

* Updated Czech translation.
  (`#854 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/854>`_)
  (`#853 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/853>`_)
  (`#835 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/835>`_)
  (`#813 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/813>`_)

* Update Spanish translation.
  (`#862 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/862>`_)
  (`#867 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/867>`_)

Packaging
---------
* The original `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang lines can now be
  retained by passing `USE_ENV_PYTHON=1` to `make` when installing.
  (`#850 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/850>`_)

* The Makefile is now resilient to DESTDIR and prefix containing whitespace.
  (`#858 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/858>`_)

* The vendored `qtpy` library was updated to `v1.4.2`.

* `python3-distutils` is needed to build cola on Debian.
  (`#837 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/837>`_)

Fixes
-----
* The "C" key no longer closes the message dialogs, for example the
  one that is shown when a commit fails its pre-commit hooks.
  This allows "Ctrl+C" copy to work, rather than closing the dialog.
  (`#734 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/734>`_)

* Dock widgets sizes are now properly saved and restored when the main
  window is maximized.
  (`#848 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/848>`_)

* The spellcheck feature was broken under Python3.
  (`#857 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/857>`_)

* A regression when saving stashes was fixed.
  (`#847 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/847>`_)

* Diffing image files was not updating the available context menus,
  which prevented the "Stage" action from being present in the menu.
  (`#841 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/841>`_)

* `git cola` now detects when `git lfs uninstall` has been run.  This allows
  you to re-initialize "Git LFS" in an existing repository where it had been
  previously uninstalled.
  (`#842 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/842>`_)

* Custom color values that did not contain any hexadecimal digits in the
  `a-f` range were being converted into integers by the config reader.  This
  then caused the configured colors to be ignored.

  These color values are now interpreted correctly.  Additionally, color
  values can now use an optional HTML-like `#` prefix.

  Example `.gitconfig` snippet::

    [cola "color"]
        text = "#0a0303"

  (`#836 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/836>`_)
  (`#849 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/849>`_)

* We now display an error message graphically when `Git` is not installed.
  Previously, the message went to stderr only.
  (`#830 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/830>`_)

* Changing diff options was causing resulting in an exception.
  (`#833 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/833>`_)
  (`#834 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/834>`_)

* The DAG window now updates itself when branches and tags are created.
  (`#814 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/814>`_)

* The user's `$PATH` environment variable can now contain utf-8
  encoded paths.  Previously, launching external commands could
  lead to tracebacks.
  (`#807 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/807>`_)

* Git Cola development sandboxes can now be stored on utf-8 encoded
  filesystem paths.  Previously, the interactive rebase feature
  could be broken when running in that environment.
  (`#825 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/825>`_)

* The log window now uses an ISO-8601 timestamp, which
  avoids localized output in the log window.
  (`#817 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/817>`_)

Development
-----------
* The code base has been thoroughly sanitized using `pylint`, and
  travis is now running pylint over the entire project.

* Miscellaneous improvements and code improvements.
  (`#874 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/874>`_)

.. _v3.1:

git-cola v3.1
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The "Browser" widget learned to rename files using "git mv".
  (`#239 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/239>`_)

* The "Diff" widget learned to diff images.  Side-by-side and pixel diff
  modes allow you to inspect changes to common images formats.
  (`#444 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/444>`_)
  (`#803 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/803>`_)

* Git LFS and Git Annex are natively supported by the image diff viewer.

* Git Annex operations are now included. `git annex init` can be performed on
  repositories, and `git annex add` can be run on untracked files from the
  status widget.  Install `git-annex` to activate this feature.

* Git LFS operations are now included. `git lfs install` can be performed on
  repositories, and `git lfs track` can be run on untracked files from the
  status widget.  Install `git-lfs` to activate this feature.

* The "Stash" tool learned to stash staged changes only.  Select the
  "Stage Index" option and only staged changes will be stashed away.
  (`#413 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/413>`_)

* The "Stash" tool learned to use vim-like navigation keyboard shortcuts,
  shows error messages when things go wrong, and now saves the "Stash Index"
  and "Keep Index" options across sessions.

* The Edit menu's "Copy" and "Select All" actions now forward to either the
  diff, status, recent, or favorites widgets, based on which widget has focus.

* The "File" and "Edit" menu can now be activated using `Alt-{f,e}` hotkeys.
  (`#759 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/759>`_)

* It was easy to accidentally trigger the first action in the `Status` tool's
  context menu when using a quick right-click to bring up the menu.
  A short sub-second delay was added to ensure that the top-most action is not
  triggered unless enough time has passed.  This prevents accidental
  activation of the first item (typically "Stage" or "Unstage") without
  burdening common use cases.
  (`#755 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/755>`_)
  (`#643 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/643>`_)

* The "Ctrl+S" hotkey now works for the header items in the Status tool.
  Selected the "Modified" header item and activating the "Stage" hotkey,
  for example, will stage all modified files.  This works for the "Staged",
  "Modified", and "Untracked" headers.  This is not enabled for the
  "Unmerged" header by design.
  (`#772 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/772>`_)

* The list of "Recent" repositories previously capped the number of
  repositories shown to 8 repositories.  This can be set to a higher
  value by setting the `cola.maxrecent` configuration variable.
  (`#752 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/752>`_)

* The "Create Branch" dialog now prevents invalid branch names.
  (`#765 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/765>`_)

* Updated Turkish translation.
  (`#756 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/756>`_)

* Updated Ukrainian translation.
  (`#753 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/753>`_)

* Updated German translation.
  (`#802 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/802>`_)

* Updated Czech translation
  (`#792 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/792>`_)
  (`#806 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/806>`_)

* The window title can be configured to not display the absolute path of the
  repository.
  (`#775 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/775>`_)

* The "Edit Remotes" editor learned to edit remote URLS.

* Bare repositories can now be created by selecting the
  "New Bare Repository..." action from the `File` menu.

* The "Branches" widget learned to configure upstream branches.

* A new `git cola clone` sub-command was added for cloning repositories.

Packaging
---------
* The vendored `qtpy` library was updated to `v1.3.1`.

* The macOS installation was made simpler for better compatibility with
  Homebrew.
  (`#636 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/636>`_)

* The Windows installer is now much simpler.  Git Cola now bundles
  Python and PyQt5, so users need only install the "Git for Windows"
  and "Git Cola" installers to get things working.

Fixes
-----
* Uninitialized difftool errors will now be displayed graphically.
  They were previously going to the shell.
  (`#457 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/457>`_)

* Translations marked "fuzzy" will no longer be used when translating strings.
  (`#782 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/782>`_)

* Deleted unmerged files will now correctly use a deleted icon.
  (`#479 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/479>`_)

* The `Ctrl+C` "Copy" hotkey on the diff viewer has been fixed.
  (`#767 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/767>`_)

* The "Create Tag" dialog did not correctly handle the case when a signed
  tag is requested, but no message is provided, and the user chooses to
  create an unannotated tag instead.  This convenience fallback will now
  properly create an unsigned, unannotated tag.
  (`#696 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/696>`_)

* `.gitconfig` and `.git/config` values editable by the Preferences dialog
  (aka `git cola config`) will now get unset when set to an empty value.
  For example, setting a different `user.email` in the current repository,
  followed by a subsequent emptying of that field, would previously result in
  an empty string getting stored in the config.  This has been fixed so that
  the value will now get unset in the config instead.
  (`#406 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/406>`_)

* Spelling and typofixes.
  (`#748 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/748>`_)

* `core.commentChar` is now honored when set in the local repository
  `.git/config`.
  (`#766 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/766>`_)

* The log window was using a format string that did not display
  correctly in all locales.  A locale-aware format is now used.
  (`#800 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/800>`_)

* The dialog displayed when prompting for a reference could sometimes
  lose focus.
  (`#804 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/804>`_)

.. _v3.0:

git-cola v3.0
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Updated Simplified Chinese translation.
  (`#726 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/726>`_)

* Updated Ukrainian translation.
  (`#723 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/723>`_)

* New Czech translation.
  (`#736 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/736>`_)
  (`#737 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/737>`_)
  (`#740 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/740>`_)
  (`#743 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/743>`_)

* The "name" field in the "Create Tag" dialog now includes autocompletion,
  which makes it easy to see which tags currently exist.

* `git cola` now has configurable toolbars.  Use the `View -> Add toolbar`
  menu item to add a toolbar.

* Setting `cola.expandtab` to `true` will now expand tabs into spaces
  in the commit message editor.  The number of spaces to insert is determined
  by consulting `cola.tabwidth`, which defaults to `8`.

* The "Copy SHA-1" hotkey is now `Alt + Ctrl + C`, to avoid clobbering the
  ability to copy text from the DAG window.
  (`#705 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/705>`_)

* The "Prepare Commit Message" action can now be invoked via the
  `Ctrl+Shift+Return` shortcut.
  (`#707 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/707>`_)

* The `Branches` pane now has a filter field that highlights branches whose
  names match the string entered into its text field.
  (`#713 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/713>`_)

* Actions that are triggered in response to button presses were being
  triggered when the button was pressed, rather than when it was released,
  which was a usability flaw.  All buttons now respond when clicked
  rather than when pressed.
  (`#715 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/715>`_)

* The DAG window will now only refresh when object IDs change.
  Previously, the DAG would redraw itself in response to inotify events,
  such as filesystem operations, which was disruptive when inspecting a large
  diff in its diff viewer.  The DAG will now only redraw when the object IDs
  corresponding to its query input changes.  Furthermore, when redrawing, the
  scrollbar positions are retained to minimize disruption to the viewport
  contents.

* The "About" dialog now includes the SHA-1 where Git Cola was built.
  (`#530 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/530>`_)

* The "Status" widget now has "Copy Leading Path to Clipboard" and
  "Copy Basename to Clipboard" actions.
  (`#435 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/435>`_)
  (`#436 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/436>`_)

* The "Status" widget now supports custom "Copy ... to Clipboard" actions.
  (`#437 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/437>`_)

* The main menu now has an "Edit" menu.
  (`#725 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/725>`_)

* `git dag` learned to checkout commits into a detached HEAD state.
  (`#698 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/698>`_)

* The `status` widget's context menus now omit actions selection-dependent
  actions when no file is selected.
  (`#731 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/731>`_)

* The startup dialog now focuses the repository list so that repositories
  can be selected with the keyboard without mouse intervention.
  (`#741 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/741>`_)

Fixes
-----
* `git dag` now prevents nodes from overlapping in more situations.
  (`#689 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/689>`_)

* Adding untracked Git submodule repo directories previously ran
  `git add submodule/` but we now call `git add submodule` without
  the trailing slash (`/`) to avoid staging files that belong to the
  submodule (which is possibly a `git` bug).  By working around the
  buggy behavior we allow users to recover by issuing the appropriate
  `git submodule add` command to properly register the submodule.
  (`#681 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/681>`_)

* We now avoid `git for-each-ref --sort=version:refname` on versions
  of `git` older than `v2.7.0`.  Previously we only avoided it for
  versions older than `v2.0.0`, which was a mistake.
  (`#686 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/686>`_)

* The error message displayed when `git` is not installed has been fixed.
  (`#686 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/686>`_)

* Adding new remotes was silently broken.
  (`#684 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/684>`_)
  (`#685 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/685>`_)

  `cola.refreshonfocus` feature was enabled, as reported on Ubuntu 16.04.
  (`#690 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/690>`_)

* Restored support for PyQt 4.6 (Centos 6.8)
  (`#692 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/692>`_)

* Switching repositories now resets the "Amend Mode" and other settings
  when switching.
  (`#710 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/710>`_)

* `git rebase` error messages now displayed when rebasing fails or stops
  via the standalone `git cola rebase` front-end.
  (`#721 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/721>`_)

* `git cola` learned to stage broken symlinks.
  (`#727 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/727>`_)

* The "View History" feature in the `Browser` tool was fixed, and now
  disambiguates between refs and paths.
  (`#732 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/732>`_)

* The diff editor now has better support for files with CRLF `\r\n`
  line endings.
  (`#730 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/730>`_)

* `cola.inotify` in a repo-local config is now honored
  when `git cola` is launched from a desktop entry (`git cola --prompt`).
  (`#695 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/695>`_)

.. _v2.11:

* New Ukrainian translation.
  (`#670 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/670>`_)
  (`#672 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/672>`_)

* New and improved French translations.

* The new `Branches` widget makes it easier to checkout, merge, push,
  and pull branches from a single interface.

* `git cola` now includes a dark icon theme.  The dark icon theme can be
  activated either by setting the `GIT_COLA_ICON_THEME` environment variable
  to `dark`, by configuring `cola.icontheme` to `dark`, or by specifying
  `--icon-theme=dark` on the command line.
  (`#638 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/638>`_)

* Autocompletion was added to the `Fetch`, `Push`, and `Pull` dialogs.

* The commit message editor now remembers the "Spellcheck" setting
  after exiting.
  (`#645 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/645>`_)

* `git dag` now uses an improved algorithm for laying out the graph,
  which avoids collisions under certain graph configurations, and
  avoids overlapping tag with commits.

* `git dag` now remembers its column sizes across sessions.
  (`#674 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/674>`_)

* `Grep` now shows a preview of the selected file's content in a split window
  below the grep results.

* `Grep` now includes line numbers in the preview pane's output.

* `Edit Remotes` now remembers its window settings after exiting.

* `Diff` now has an option to display line numbers in the editor.
  (`#136 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/136>`_)

* `Amend Last Commit` can now be triggered via the `Commit` menu in addition
  to the commit message editor's options.
  (`#640 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/640>`_)

* The `File Browser` tool was made much faster and can now operate on
  much larger repositories.
  (`#499 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/499>`_)

* A new "turbo" mode was added that allows you to opt-out of operations
  that can slow `git cola` on large repositories.  The turbo mode is
  enabled by configuring `git config cola.turbo true`.  Turbo mode
  disables the background loading of Git commit messages and other
  details in the `File Browser` widget.

* A new GitIgnore dialog allows adding custom gitignore patterns.
  (`#653 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/653>`_)

* The spellchecker in `git cola` can now use an additional dictionary
  by configuring `cola.dictionary` to the path to a file containing
  a newline-separated list of words.
  (`#663 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/663>`_)

* The stash, export patches, diff, and gitignore dialogs now remember
  their window sizes.

* A new `git cola recent` sub-command was added for finding recently
  edited files.

* The `Fetch` dialog now allows pruning remote branches.
  (`#639 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/639>`_)
  (`#680 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/680>`_)

Fixes
-----
* `git cola`'s spellchecker now supports the new `dict-common` filesystem
  layout, and prefers the `/usr/share/dict/cracklib-small` file over the
  `/usr/share/dict/words` provided on older distributions.
  This makes the spellchecker compatible with Arch, which does not provide
  a `words` symlink like Debian.
  (`#663 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/663>`_)

* Properly handle the case where an existing file is untracked using
  the File Browser.

* Fix a quirk where the "Create Branch" dialog sometimes required clicking
  twice on the radio buttons.
  (`#662 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/662>`_)

* Fixed a focus issue to ensure that "Push", "Fetch", and "Pull" can
  be executed with the press of a single enter key after being shown.
  (`#661 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/661>`_)

* Committing is now allowed in when resolving a merge results in no
  changes.  This state was previously prevented by the commit message editor,
  which prevented users from resolving merges that result in no changes.
  (`#679 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/679>`_)

* The filesystem monitor would sometimes emit backtraces when directories
  are modified.  This has been fixed.
  (`bz #1438522 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1438522>`_)

* Absolute paths are now returned when querying for `.git`-relative paths
  from within a submodule, which uses `.git`-files.
  This fixes launching `git cola` from within a subdirectory of a submodule.
  (`#675 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/675>`_)

.. _v2.10:

git-cola v2.10
==============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola` can now invoke the `.git/hooks/cola-prepare-commit-msg`
  hook to update the commit message.  This hook takes the same parameters
  as Git's `prepare-commit-message` hook.  The default path to this hook
  can be overridden by setting the `cola.prepareCommitMessageHook`
  configuration variable.
  (`Documentation <https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#prepare-commit-message>`_)

* `git cola diff` (and the corresponding `Diff` menu actions) can now
  launch difftool with the standard `Ctrl+D` hotkey.  The `Ctrl+E` hotkey was
  also added for launching an editor.

* Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translation updates.

Fixes
-----
* `git cola` now works when installed in non-ascii, utf8-encoded paths.
  (`#629 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/629>`_)

* Styling issues that caused black backgrounds in various widgets when using
  PyQ5 on Mac OS X have been fixed.
  (`#624 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/624>`_)

* The "Open Recent" menu action was broken and has been fixed.
  (`#634 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/634>`_)

* Exiting `git cola` with a maximized main window would hang when reopened
  on Linux.
  (`#641 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/641>`_)

---------
* `appdata.xml` files are now provided at

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New Polish translation thanks to Łukasz Wojniłowicz
  (`#598 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/598>`_)

* The `Bypass Commit Hooks` feature now disables itself automatically
  when a new commit is created.  The new behavior turns the option into a
  single-use flag, which helps prevent users from accidentally leaving it
  active longer than intended.
  (`#595 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/595>`_)

* `git dag` learned to launch an external diff viewer on selected commits.
  The standard `Ctrl+D` shortcut can be used to view diffs.
  (`#468 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/468>`_)

* `git dag` learned to launch directory diffs via `git difftool --dir-diff`.
  The `Ctrl+Shift+D` shortcut launches difftool in directory-diff mode.
  (`#468 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/468>`_)

* Items in the "Favorites" list can now be renamed, which makes it

  (`#601 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/601>`_)

* The startup screen now includes a logo and `git cola` version information.
  (`#526 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/526>`_)

* The `About` page was revamped to contain multiple tabs.  A new tab was added
  that provides details about `git cola`''s dependencies.  New tabs were also
  added for giving credit to `git cola`'s authors and translators.

* The `About` page can now be accessed via `git cola about`.

* The "Fast-forward only" and "No fast-forward" options supported by
  `git pull` are now accessible via `git cola pull`.

* Doing a forced push no longer requires selecting the remote branch.
  (`#618 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/618>`_)

* `git cola push` now has an option to suppress the prompt that is shown
  when pushing would create new remote branches.
  (`#605 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/605>`_)

* `git dag` now shows commit messages in a more readable color.
  (`#574 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/574>`_)

* `git cola browse` and the `status` widget learned to launch the OS-specified
  default action for a file.  When used on directories via `git cola browse`,
  or when "Open Parent Directory" is used on files, the OS-specified
  file browser will typically be used.

* `git cola browse` and the `status` widget learned to launch terminals.

Fixes
-----
* `git cola browse` was not updating when expanding items.
  (`#588 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/588>`_)

* Typofixes in comments, naming, and strings have been applied.
  (`#593 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/593>`_)

* The inotify and win32 filesystem monitoring no longer refreshes
  when updates are made to ignored files.
  (`#517 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/517>`_)
  (`#516 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/516>`_)

* The `Refresh` button on the actions panel no longer raises an
  exception when using PyQt5.
  (`#604 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/604>`_)

* Fixed a typo in the inotify backend that is triggered when files are removed.
  (`#607 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/607>`_)

* Fixed a typo when recovering from a failed attempt to open a repository.
  (`#606 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/606>`_)

* `git dag` now properly updates itself when launched from the menubar.
  (`#613 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/613>`_)

* If git-cola is invoked on Windows using `start pythonw git-cola`,
  a console window will briefly flash on the screen each time
  `git cola` invokes `git`.  The console window is now suppressed.

* We now avoid some problematic Popen flags on Windows which were
  breaking the `git rebase` feature on Windows.

* The `Save` button in `git dag`'s "Grab File..." feature now properly
  prompts for a filename when saving files.
  (`#617 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/617>`_)

Development
-----------
* The `qtpy` symlink in the source tree has been removed to allow for easier
  development on Windows.

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola push` learned to configure upstream branches.
  (`#563 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/563>`_)

Fixes
-----
* The diffstat view is now properly updated when notifications are
  received via inotify filesystem monitoring.
  (`#577 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/577>`_)

* Python3 with PyQt5 had a bug that prevented `git cola` from starting.
  (`#589 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/589>`_)

.. _v2.7:

git-cola v2.7
=============

Fixes
-----

* When repositories stored in non-ASCII, UTF-8-encoded filesystem paths
  were operated upon with `LC_ALL=C` set in the environment, unicode errors
  would occur when using `python2`.  `git cola` was made more robust and will
  now operate correctly within this environment.
  (`#581 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/581>`_)

* Support for the `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variable was fixed.
  (`#582 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/582>`_)

Development
-----------

* The `unittest.mock` module is now used instead of the original `mock` module
  when running the `git cola` test suite using Python3.
  (`#569 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/569>`_)

Packaging
---------

* `git cola` is now compatible with *PyQt5*, *PyQt4*, and *Pyside*.
  `git cola` previously supported *PyQt4* only, but will now use whichever
  library is available.  Users are not required to upgrade at this time,
  but *PyQt5* support can be enabled anytime by making its python
  modules available.
  (`#232 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/232>`_)

  *NOTE*: We do not yet recommend using *PyQt5* because there are known
  exit-on-segfault bugs in *Qt5* that have not yet been addressed.
  `git cola` is sensitive to this bug and is known to crash on exit
  when using `git dag` or the interactive rebase feature on *PyQt5*.

  https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-52988

  *PyQt4* is stable and there are no known issues when using it so
  we recommend using it until the Qt5 bugs have been resolved.

* `git cola` now depends on *QtPy* and includes a bundled copy of the
  `qtpy` library.  If you are packaging `git cola` and would prefer to use
  `qtpy` from your distribution instead of the built-in version then use
  `make NO_VENDOR_LIBS=1` when building `git cola`.  This will prevent
  vendored libraries from being installed.

.. _v2.6:

git-cola v2.6
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------

* A new "Reset" sub-menu provides access to running "git reset --mixed"
  when resetting branch heads and "git reset  --merge" when resetting
  worktrees.
  (`#542 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/542>`_)

* `git cola` now supports linked worktrees, i.e. worktrees created by
  `git worktree`.
  (`#554 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/554>`_)

Fixes
-----

* Diff highlighting is now robust to the user having
  diff.supressBlankEmpty=true in their git config.
  (`#541 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/541>`_)

* The filesystem monitor now properly handles repositories that use
  `.git`-files, e.g. when using submodules.
  (`#545 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/545>`_)
  (`#546 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pulls/546>`_)

* Per-repository git configuration is now properly detected when launching
  `git cola` from an application launcher.
  (`#548 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/548>`_)

* `git cola` now cleans up after itself immediately to avoid leaving behind
  empty `/tmp/git-cola-XXXXXX` directories when the user uses `Ctrl+C`
  to quit the app.
  (`#566 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/566>`_)

Packaging
---------

* It is now possible to install `git cola` to and from utf8-encoded filesystem
  paths.  Previously, Python's stdlib would throw an encoding error during
  installation.  We workaround the stdlib by forcing python2 to use utf-8,
  thus fixing assumptions in the stdlib library code.
  (`#551 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/551>`_)

.. _v2.5:

git-cola v2.5
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------

* The icon for untracked files was adjusted to better differentiate
  between files and the "Untracked" header.
  (`#509 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/509>`_)

* Ctrl+O was added as a hotkey for opening repositories.
  (`#507 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/507>`_)

* `git dag` now uses consistent edge colors across updates.
  (`#512 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/512>`_)

* `git cola`'s Bookmarks widget can now be used to set a "Default Repository".
  Under the hood, we set the `cola.defaultrepo` configuration variable.
  The default repository is used whenever `git cola` is launched outside of
  a Git repository.  When unset, or when set to a bogus value, `git cola`
  will prompt for a repository, as it previously did.
  (`#513 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/513>`_)

* `git cola`'s Russian and Spanish translations were improved
  thanks to Vaiz and Zeioth.
  (`#514 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/514>`_)
  (`#515 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/515>`_)

* `git cola` was translated to Turkish thanks to Barış ÇELİK.
  (`#520 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/520>`_)

* The status view now supports launching `git gui blame`.  It can be
  configured to use a different command by setting `cola.blameviewer`.
  (`#521 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/521>`_)

* `git dag` now allows selecting non-contiguous ranges in the log widget.
  (`#468 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/468>`_)

* Any font can now be chosen for the diff editor, not just monospace fonts.
  (`#525 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/525>`_)

Fixes
-----

* `xfce4-terminal` and `gnome-terminal` are now supported when launching
  `git mergetool` to resolve merges.  These terminals require that the command
  to execute is shell-quoted and passed as a single string argument to `-e`
  rather than as additional command line arguments.
  (`#524 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/524>`_)

* Fixed a unicode problem when formatting the error message that is shown
  when `gitk` is not installed.  We now handle unicode data in tracebacks
  generated by python itself.
  (`#528 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/528>`_)

* The `New repository` feature was fixed.
  (`#533 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/533>`_)

* We now use omit the extended description when creating "fixup!" commits,
  for consistency with the Git CLI.  We now include only the one-line summary
  in the final commit message.
  (`#522 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/522>`_)

.. _v2.4:

git-cola v2.4
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------

* The user interface is now HiDPI-capable.  git-cola now uses SVG
  icons, and its interface can be scaled by setting the `GIT_COLA_SCALE`
  environment variable.

* `git dag` now supports the standard editor, difftool, and history hotkeys.
  It is now possible to invoke these actions from file widget's context
  menu and through the standard hotkeys.
  (`#473 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/473>`_)

* The `Status` tool also learned about the history hotkey.
  Additionally, the `Alt-{j,k}` aliases are also supported in the `Status`
  tool for consistency with the other tools where the non-Alt hotkeys are not
  available.
  (`#488 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/488>`_)

* The `File Browser` tool now has better default column sizes,
  and remembers its window size and placement.

* The `File Browser` now supports the refresh hotkey, and has better
  behavior when refreshing.  The selection is now retained, and new and
  removed files are found when refreshing.

* A new `git-cola-completion.bash` completion script is provided in the
  `contrib/` directory.  It must be used alongside Git's completion script.
  Source it from your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`, etc) after sourcing
  the `git-completion.bash` script and you will have command-line completion
  support for the `git cola` and `git dag` sub-commands.

* The "checkout" dialog now offers completion for remote branches and other
  git refs.  This makes it easier to checkout remote branches in a detached
  head state.  Additionally, the checkout dialog also offers completion for
  remote branches that have not yet been checked out, which makes it easier to
  create a local tracking branch by just completing for that potential name.
  (`#390 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/390>`_)

* The "create branch" and "create tag" dialogs now save and restore their
  window settings.

* The "status" widget can now be configured to use a bold font with a darker
  background for the header items.
  (`#506 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/506>`_)

* The "status" widget now remembers its horizontol scrollbar position across
  updates.  This is helpful when working on projects with long paths.
  (`#494 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/494>`_)

Fixes
-----

* When using *Git for Windows*, a `git` window would appear
  when running *Windows 8*.  We now pass additional flags to
  `subprocess.Popen` to prevent a `git` window from appearing.
  (`#477 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/477>`_)
  (`#486 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/486>`_)

* Launching difftool with `.PY` in `$PATHEXT` on Windows was fixed.
  (`#492 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/492>`_)

* Creating a local branch tracking a remote branch that contains
  slashes in its name is now properly handled.
  (`#496 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/496>`_)

* The "Browse Other Branch" feature was broken by Python3, and is now fixed.
  (`#501 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/501>`_)

  (`#508 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/508>`_)

* Miscellaneous fixes
  (`#485 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/485>`_)

Packaging
---------

* git-cola's documentation no longer uses an intersphinx link mapping
  to docs.python.org.  This fixes warnings when building rpms using koji,
  where network access is prevented.

.. _v2.3:

git-cola v2.3
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------

* The Interactive Rebase feature now works on Windows!
  (`#463 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/463>`_)

* The `diff` editor now understands vim-style `hjkl` navigation hotkeys.
  (`#476 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/476>`_)

* `Alt-{j,k}` navigation hotkeys were added to allow changing to the
  next/previous file from the diff and commit editors.

* The `Rename branch` menu action is now disabled in empty repositories.
  (`#475 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/475>`_)
  (`#459 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/459>`_)

* `git cola` now checks unmerged files for conflict markers before
  staging them.  This feature can be disabled in the preferences.
  (`#464 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/464>`_)

* `git dag` now remembers which commits were selected when refreshing
  so that it can restore the selection afterwards.
  (`#480 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/480>`_)

* "Launch Editor", "Launch Difftool", "Stage/Unstage",
  and "Move Up/Down" hotkeys now work when the commit message
  editor has focus.
  (`#453 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/453>`_)

* The diff editor now supports the `Ctrl+u` hotkey for reverting
  diff hunks and selected lines.

* The `core.commentChar` Git configuration value is now honored.
  Commit messages and rebase instruction sheets will now use
  the configured character for comments.  This allows having
  commit messages that start with `#` when `core.commentChar`
  is configured to its non-default value.
  (`#446 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/446>`_)

Fixes
-----

* Diff syntax highlighting was improved to handle more edge cases
  and false positives.
  (`#467 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/467>`_)

* Setting commands in the interactive rebase editor was fixed.
  (`#472 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/472>`_)

* git-cola no longer clobbers the Ctrl+Backspace text editing shortcut
  in the commit message editor.
  (`#453 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/453>`_)

* The copy/paste clipboard now persists after `git cola` exits.
  (`#484 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/484>`_)

.. _v2.2.1:

git-cola v2.2.1
===============

Fixes
-----
* Fixed the "Sign off" feature in the commit message editor.

.. _v2.2:

git-cola v2.2
=============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Double-click will now choose a commit in the "Select commit" dialog.

* `git cola` has a feature that reads `.git/MERGE_MSG` and friends for the
  commit message when a merge is in-progress.  Upon refresh, `git cola` will
  now detect when a merge has completed and reset the commit message back to
  its previous state.  It is only reset if the editor contains a message
  that was read from the file and has not been manually edited by the user.

* The commit message editor's context menu now has a "Clear..." action for
  clearing the message across both the summary and description fields.

* Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translation updates.

* The system theme's icons are now used wherever possible.
  (`#458 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/458>`_)

Fixes
-----
* The stash viewer now uses ``git show --no-ext-diff`` to avoid running
  user-configured diff tools.

* `git cola` now uses the `setsid()` system call to ensure that the
  `GIT_ASKPASS` and `SSH_ASKPASS` helper programs are used when pushing
  changes using `git`.  The askpass helpers will now be used even when
  `git cola` is launched from a terminal.

  The behavior without `setsid()` is that `git cola` can appear to hang while
  pushing changes.  The hang happens when `git` prompts the user for a
  password using the terminal, but the user never sees the prompt.  `setsid()`
  detaches the terminal, which ensures that the askpass helpers are used.
  (`#218 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/218>`_)
  (`#262 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/262>`_)
  (`#377 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/377>`_)

* `git dag`'s file list tool was updated to properly handle unicode paths.

* `gnome-terminal` is no longer used by default when `cola.terminal` is unset.
  It is broken, as was detailed in #456.
  (`#456 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/456>`_)

* The interactive rebase feature was not always setting `$GIT_EDITOR`
  to the value of `gui.editor`, thus there could be instances where rebase
  will seem to not stop, or hang, when performing "reword" actions.

  We now set the `$GIT_EDITOR` environment variable when performing the
  "Continue", "Skip", and "Edit Todo" rebase actions so that the correct
  editor is used during the rebase.
  (`#445 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/445>`_)

Packaging
---------
* `git cola` moved from a 3-part version number to a simpler 2-part "vX.Y"
  version number.  Most of our releases tend to contain new features.

.. _v2.1.2:

git-cola v2.1.2
===============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Updated zh_TW translations.

* `git cola rebase` now defaults to `@{upstream}`, and generally uses the same
  CLI syntax as `git rebase`.

* The commit message editor now allows you to bypass commit hooks by selecting
  the "Bypass Commit Hooks" option.  This is equivalent to passing the
  `--no-verify` option to `git commit`.
  (`#357 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/357>`_)

* We now prevent the "Delete Files" action from creating a dialog that does
  not fit on screen.
  (`#378 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/378>`_)

* `git xbase` learned to edit rebase instruction sheets that contain
  `exec` commands.

* The diff colors are now configurable.  `cola.color.{text,add,remove,header}`
  can now be set with 6-digit hexadecimal colors.
  See the `git cola manual <https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-cola.html#configuration-variables>_`
  for more details.

* Improved hotkey documentation.

Fixes
-----

  worktree when `rebase.autostash` is set.
  (`#360 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/360>`_)

.. _v2.1.1:

git-cola v2.1.1
===============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* A new "Find files" widget was added, and can be activated by
  using the `Ctrl+t` or `t` hotkeys.

* A new `git cola find` sub-command was added for finding files.

* `git cola` now remembers the text cursor's position when staging
  interactively with the keyboard.  This makes it easier to use the keyboard
  arrows to select and stage lines.

  when `Enter` or `Return` are pressed.

* You can now refresh using `F5` in addition to the existing `Ctrl+R` hotkey.

* Untracked files are now displayed using a unique icon.
  (`#388 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/388>`_)

Fixes
-----

  (`bz #181676 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181686>`_)

* inotify expects unicode paths on Python3.
  (`#393 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/393>`_)

  (`#358 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/358>`_)

* Custom GUI actions can now define their own keyboard shortcuts by
  setting `guitool.$name.shortcut` to a string understood by Qt's
  `QAction::setShortcut()` API, e.g. `Alt+X`.
  See the
  `Qt docs <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qkeysequence.html#QKeySequence-2>`_
  for more details about the supported values.

* `git cola` learned to rename branches.
  (`#364 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/364>`_)
  (`#278 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/278>`_)

* `git dag` now has a "Show history" context menu which can be used to filter
  history using the selected paths.

Fixes
-----
* `sphinxtogithub.py` was fixed for Python3.
  (`#353 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/353>`_)

* The commit that changed how we read remotes from `git remote`
  to parsing `git config` was reverted since it created problems
  for some users.

* Fixed a crash when using the `rebase edit` feature.

* Better drag-and-drop behavior when dropping into gnome-terminal.
  (`#373 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/373>`_)

Packaging
---------
* The `git-cola-folder-handler.desktop` file handler was fixed
  to pass validation by `desktop-file-validate`.
  (`#356 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/356>`_)

* The `git.svg` icon was renamed to `git-cola.svg`, and `git cola` was taught
  to prefer icons from the desktop theme when available.

git-cola v2.0.7
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New hotkey: `Ctrl+Shift+M` merges branches.

* New hotkey: `Ctrl+R` refreshes the DAG viewer.
  (`#347 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/347>`_)

Fixes
-----
* We now use `git config` to parse the list of remotes
  instead of parsing the output of `git remote`, which
  is a Git porcelain and should not be used by scripts.

* Avoid "C++ object has been deleted" errors from PyQt4.
  (`#346 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/346>`_)

Packaging
---------
* The `make install` target now uses `install` instead of `cp`.

  (`#213 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/213>`_)

* Fix "known incorrect sRGB profile" in `staged-item.png`.
  (`gentoo-devel message #85066
  <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/85066>`_)

.. _v1.9.2:

git-cola v1.9.2
===============
Fixes
-----
* Fix a traceback when `git push` fails.
  (`bz #1034778 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1034778>`_)

Packaging
---------
* Most of the git-cola sub-packages have been removed.
  The only remaining packages are `cola`, `cola.models`,
  and `cola.widgets`.

* The translation file for Simplified Chinese was renamed
  to `zh_CN.po`.
  (`#209 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/209>`_)

.. _v1.9.1:

git-cola v1.9.1
===============
Packaging
---------
* `git cola version --brief` now prints the brief version number.

Fixes
-----
* Resurrected the "make dist" target, for those that prefer to create
  their own tarballs.

* Fixed the typo that broke the preferences dialog.

.. _v1.9.0:

git-cola v1.9.0
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now ship a full-featured interactive `git rebase` editor.
  The rebase todo file is edited using the `git xbase` script which
  is provided at `$prefix/share/git-cola/bin/git-xbase`.
  This script can be used standalone by setting the `$GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`
  before running `git rebase --interactive`.
  (`#1 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/1>`_)

* Fixup commit messages can now be loaded from the commit message editor.

* Tool widgets can be locked in place by using the "Tools/Lock Layout"
  menu action.
  (`#202 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/202>`_)

* You can now push to several remotes simultaneously by selecting
  multiple remotes in the "Push" dialog.
  (`#148 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/148>`_)

* The `grep` tool learned to search using three different modes:
  basic regular expressions (default), extended regular expressions,
  and fixed strings.

Packaging
---------
* `git cola` now depends on the `argparse` Python module.
  This module is part of the stdlib in Python 2.7 and must
  be installed separately when using Python 2.6 and below.

Fixes
-----
* Support unicode in the output from `fetch`, `push`, and `pull`.

.. _v1.8.5:

git-cola v1.8.5
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now detect when the editor or history browser are misconfigured.
  (`#197 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/197>`_)
  (`bz #886826 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=886826>`_)

* Display of untracked files can be disabled from the Preferences dialog
  or by setting the `gui.displayuntracked` configuration variable to `false`.
  (`Git Mailing List on 2013-08-21
  <https://public-inbox.org/git/20130821032913.GA6092@wheezy.local/>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Unicode stash names are now supported
  (`#198 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/198>`_)

* The diffs produced when reverting workspace changes were made more robust.

.. _v1.8.4:

git-cola v1.8.4
=======================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Brand new German translation thanks to Sven Claussner.

* The "File" menu now provides a "New Repository..." menu action.

* `git dag` now uses a dock-widget interface so that its widgets can
  be laid-out and arranged.  Customizations are saved and restored
  the next time `git dag` is launched.

* `git dag` now has a "Zoom Best Fit" button next alongside the
  "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" buttons.

* `Ctrl+L` now focuses the "Search" field in the `git dag` tool.

* Right-clicking in the "diff" viewer now updates the cursor position
  before performing actions, which makes it much easier to click around
  and selectively stage sections.  Previously, the current cursor position
  was used which meant that it required two clicks (left-click to update
  the position followed by right-click to get the context menu) for the
  desired section to be used.  This is now a single right-click operation.

* The `Ctrl+D` "Launch Diff Tool" action learned to automatically choose
  between `git difftool` and `git mergetool`.  If the file is unmerged then
  we automatically launch `git mergetool` on the path, otherwise we use
  `git difftool`.  We do this because `git difftool` is not intended to
  be used on unmerged paths.  Automatically using `git mergetool` when
  appropriate is the most intuitive and muscle-memory-friendly thing to do.

* You can now right-click on folders in your standard file browser
  and choose "Open With -> Git Cola"  (Linux-only).

Fixes
-----
* Python 2.6 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard does not provide a namedtuple
  at `sys.version_info`.  We now avoid using that variable for better
  portability.

* We now read the user's Git configuration from `~/.config/git/config`
  if that file is available, otherwise we use the traditional `~/.gitconfig`
  path, just like Git itself.

* Some edge cases were fixed when applying partial/selected diffs.

* The diff viewer is now properly cleared when refreshing.
  (`#194 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/194>`_)

.. _v1.8.3:

git-cola v1.8.3
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The diff viewer now has an "Options" menu which can be
  used to set "git diff" options.  This can be used to
  ignore whitespace changes or to show a change with its
  surrounding function as context.
  (`#150 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/150>`_)

* `git cola` now remembers your commit message and will restore it
  when `git cola` is restarted.
  (`#175 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/175>`_)

* `Ctrl+M` can now be used to toggle the "Amend last commit"
  checkbox in the commit message editor.
  (`#161 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/161>`_)

* Deleting remote branches can now be done from the "Branch" menu.
  (`#152 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/152>`_)

* The commit message editor now has a built-in spell checker.

Fixes
-----
* We now avoid invoking external diffs when showing diffstats.
  (`#163 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/163>`_)

* The `Status` tool learned to reselect files when refreshing.
  (`#165 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/165>`_)

* `git cola` now remembers whether it has been maximized and will restore the
  maximized state when `git cola` is restarted.
  (`#172 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/172>`_)

* Performance is now vastly improved when staging hundreds or
  thousands of files.

* `git cola` was not correctly saving repo-specific configuration.
  (`#174 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/174>`_)

* Fix a UnicodeDecode in sphinxtogithub when building from source.

.. _v1.8.2:

git-cola v1.8.2
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now automatically remove missing repositories from the
  "Select Repository" dialog.
  (`#145 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/145>`_)

* A new `git cola diff` sub-command was added for diffing changed files.

Fixes
-----
* The inotify auto-refresh feature makes it difficult to select text in
  the "diff" editor when files are being continually modified by another
  process.  The auto-refresh causes it to lose the currently selected text,
  which is not wanted.  We now avoid this problem by saving and restoring
  the selection when refreshing the editor.
  (`#155 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/155>`_)

* More strings have been marked for l10n.
  (`#157 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/157>`_)

* Fixed the Alt+D Diffstat shortcut.
  (`#159 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/159>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Better error handling when cloning repositories.

  We were not handling the case where a git URL has
  no basename, e.g. `https://git.example.com/`.
  `git cola` originally rejected these URLs instead of
  allowing users to clone them.  It now allows these URLs
  when they point to valid git repositories.

  Additionally, `git cola` learned to echo the errors
  reported by `git clone` when it fails.
  (`#156 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/156>`_)

.. _v1.8.1:

git-cola v1.8.1
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` got a big visual upgrade.

* `Ctrl+G` now launches the "Grep" tool.

* `Ctrl+D` launches difftool and `Ctrl+E` launches your editor
  when in the diff panel.

* git-cola can now be told to use an alternative language.
  For example, if the native language is German and we want git-cola to
  use English then we can create a `~/.config/git-cola/language` file with
  "en" as its contents: ``echo en >~/.config/git-cola/language``
  (`#140 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/140>`_)

* A new `git cola merge` sub-command was added for merging branches.

* Less blocking in the main UI

Fixes
-----
* Autocomplete issues on KDE
  (`#144 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/144>`_)

* The "recently opened repositories" startup dialog did not
  display itself in the absence of bookmarks.
  (`#139 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/139>`_)

.. _v1.8.0:

git-cola v1.8.0
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola` learned to honor `.gitattributes` when showing and
  interactively applying diffs.  This makes it possible to store
  files in git using a non-utf-8 encoding and `git cola` will
  properly accept them.  This must be enabled by settings
  `cola.fileattributes` to true, as it incurs a small performance
  penalty.
  (`#96 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/96>`_)

* `git cola` now wraps commit messages at 72 columns automatically.
  This is configurable using the `cola.linebreak` variable to enable/disable
  the feature, and `cola.textwidth` to configure the limit.
  (`#133 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/133>`_)

* A new "Open Recent" sub-menu was added to the "File" menu.
  This makes it easy to open a recently-edited repository.
  (`#135 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/135>`_)

* We now show a preview for untracked files when they are clicked
  using the `Status` tool.
* A new "Open Using Default Application" action was added to the
  `Status` tool.  It is activated using either `Spacebar` or through
  the context menu.  This action uses `xdg-open` on Linux and
  `open` on Mac OS X.
* A new "Open Parent Directory" action was added to the `Status` tool.
  It is activated using either `Shift+Spacebar` or through the
  context menu.
* `git dag` learned to honor the `log.date` git configuration variable.
  This makes the date display follow whatever format the user has
  configured.
* A new `git cola config` sub-command was added for quickly
  tweaking `git cola`'s git configuration settings.
* Some small usability tweaks -- some user confirmation prompts
  were defaulting to "Cancel" when they should have been defaulting
  to the affirmative option instead.

Fixes
-----
* Properly handle arbitrarily-named branches.
* We went back to launching `git mergetool` using an xterm.
  The reason is that there are a couple of places where `git mergetool`
  requires a terminal for user interaction not covered by `--no-prompt`.
* We now properly handle an edge case when applying short diffs at
  the start of a file.

.. _v1.7.7:

git-cola v1.7.7
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New and improved `grep` mode lets you instantly find and edit files.
* New `git cola grep` standalone mode.
* Support for passing arguments to the configured editors, e.g. `gvim -p`
  This makes it possible to select multiple files in the status
  window and use `Ctrl-e` to edit them all at once.
* Remote operations now prompt on errors only.
* The `Tab` key now jumps to the extended description when editing the summary.
* More shortcut key labels and misc. UX improvements.

Fixes
-----
* Selecting an item no longer copies its filename to the copy/paste buffer.
  `Ctrl-c` or the "Copy" context-menu action can be used instead.
* The repository monitoring feature on Windows learned to ignore
  changes within the ".git" directory.  Thanks to Andreas Sommer.
  (`#120 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/120>`_)

.. _v1.7.6:

git-cola v1.7.6
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` learned to color-code branchy edges.
  The edge colors change when a new branch is detected,
  which makes the history much easier to follow.
  A huge thanks to Uri Okrent for making it happen.

* New GUI for editing remote repositories.

* New `git cola archive` and `git cola remote` sub-commands.

* `git cola browser` learned an 'Untrack' command.

* The diff editor learned to staged/unstaged while amending.

* The status tool can now scroll horizontally.

* New git repositories can be created by clicking 'New' on the
  `git cola --prompt` startup screen.

.. _v1.7.5:

git-cola v1.7.5
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Auto-completion was added to more tools.

* `git dag` is easier to use on smaller displays -- the author
  field elides its text which allows for a more compact display.

* Selected commits in `git dag` were made more prominent and
  easier to see.

* 'Create Branch' learned to fetch remote branches and uses a
  background thread to do so.

* User-configured GUI tools are listed alphabetically in the 'Actions' menu.

* The 'Pull' dialog remembers the value of the 'Rebase' checkbox
  between invocations.

.. _v1.7.4.1:

git-cola v1.7.4.1
=================
Fixes
-----
* Detect Homebrew so that OS X users do not need to set PYTHONPATH.

* `git dag` can export patches again.

.. _v1.7.4:

git-cola v1.7.4
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The 'Classic' tool was renamed to 'Browser' and learned to
  limit history to the current branch.

* `git dag` learned about gravatar and uses it to show images
  for commit authors.

* `git dag` learned to use OpenGL for rendering resulting in
  much faster rendering.

* More dialogs learned vim-style keyboard shortcuts.

* The commit message editor learned better arrow key navigation.

.. _v1.7.3:

git-cola v1.7.3
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola` learned a few new sub commands:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git cola dag
    git cola branch
    git cola search

* `Return` in the summary field jumps to the extended description.

* `Ctrl+Return` is now a shortcut for 'Commit'.

* Better French translation for 'Sign-off'.

* The 'Search' widget now has a much simpler and streamlined
  user interface.

* vim-style `h,j,k,l` navigation shortcuts were added to the DAG widget.

* `git dag` no longer prompts for files when diffing commits if the
  text field contains paths.

* General user interface and performance improvements.

Fixes
-----
* The diff viewer no longer changes font size when holding `Control`
  while scrolling with the mouse wheel.

* Files with a typechange (e.g. symlinks that become files, etc.)
  are now correctly identified as being modified.

Packaging
---------
* The `cola.controllers` and `cola.views` packages were removed.

.. _v1.7.2:

git-cola v1.7.2
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola` can now launch sub commands, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git cola classic
    git cola stash
    git cola fetch
    git cola push
    git cola pull
    git cola tag

* `git dag` is more responsive when gathering auto-completions.

* Keyboard shortcuts are displayed when the '?' key is pressed.

* Various keyboard shortcuts were added for improved usability.

* The status widget now lists unmerged files before modified files.

* vim-style `h,j,k,l` navigation shortcuts were added to the status widget.

* A 'Recently Modified Files...' tool was added.

* Tools can now be hidden with `Alt + #` (where `#` is a keyboard number)
  and focused with `Alt + Shift + #`.

* The syntax highlighting colors for diffs was made less intrusive.

* The commit message editor was redesigned to have a more compact
  and keyboard-convenient user interface.
  
* Keyboard shortcuts for adding a Signed-off-by (`Ctrl + i`)
  and creating a commit (`Ctrl + m`) were added.

* The status widget was adjusted to use less screen real-estate.

Fixes
-----
* Avoid updating the index when responding to inotify events.
  This avoids interfering with operations such as `git rebase --interactive`.
  (`#99 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/99>`_)

Packaging
---------
* Create `git-dag.pyw` in the win32 installer.

* win32 shortcuts now contain explicit calls to `pythonw.exe` instead of
  calling the `.pyw` file directly.

Deprecated Features
-------------------
* The 'Apply Changes from Branch...' feature was removed.
  `git dag`'s 'Grab File...' feature used alongside the index/worktree editor
  is a simpler alternative.

.. _v1.7.1.1:

git-cola v1.7.1.1
=================
Fixes
-----
* Further enhanced the staging/unstaging behavior in the status widget.
  (`#97 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/97>`_)

* Unmerged files are no longer listed as modified.

Packaging
---------
The `cola-$version` tarballs on github were originally setup to
have the same contents as the old tarballs hosted on tuxfamily.
The `make dist` target was changed to write files to a
`git-cola-$version` subdirectory and tarball.

This makes the filenames consistent for the source tarball,
the darwin .app tarball, and the win32 .exe installer.

.. _v1.7.1:

git-cola v1.7.1
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Refined the staging/unstaging behavior for code reviews.
  (`#97 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/97>`_)

* Added more styling and icons to menus and buttons.

* Adjusted some terminology to more closely match the git CLI.

Fixes
-----
* Boolean `git config` settings with no value are now supported
  (these are not created by git these days but exist in legacy repositories).

* Unicode branches and tags are supported in the "branch diff" tool.

* Guard against low-memory conditions and more interrupted system calls.

Packaging
---------
* Added desktop launchers for git-cola.desktop and git-dag.desktop.
  This replaces the old cola.desktop, so some adjustments to RPM .spec
  and debian/ files will be needed.

* Fixed the darwin app-tarball Makefile target to create relative paths.

Cleanup
-------
* The `--style` option was removed.  `git cola` follows the system theme
  so there's no need for this option these days.

.. _v1.7.0:

git-cola v1.7.0
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Export a patch series from `git dag` into a `patches/` directory.

* `git dag` learned to diff commits, slice history along paths, etc.

* Added instant-preview to the `git stash` widget.

* A simpler preferences editor is used to edit `git config` values.
  (`#90 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/90>`_)
  (`#89 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/89>`_)

* Previous commit messages can be re-loaded from the message editor.
  (`#33 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/33>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Display commits with no file changes.
  (`#82 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/82>`_)

* Improved the diff editor's copy/paste behavior
  (`#90 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/90>`_)

Packaging
---------
* Bumped version number to ceil(minimum git version).
  `git cola` now requires `git` >= 1.6.3.

* Simplified git-cola's versioning when building from tarballs
  outside of git.  We no longer check for a 'version' file at
  the root of the repository.  We instead keep a default version
  in `cola/version.py` and use it when `git cola`'s `.git` repository
  is not available.

.. _v1.4.3.5:

git-cola v1.4.3.5
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* inotify is much snappier and available on Windows
  thanks to Karl Bielefeldt.

* New right-click command to add untracked files to .gitignore
  thanks to Audrius Karabanovas.

* Stash, fetch, push, and pull usability improvements

* General usability improvements

* stderr is logged when applying partial diffs.

Fixes
-----
* Files can be unstaged when amending.
  (`#82 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/82>`_)

* Show the configured remote.$remote.pushurl in the GUI
  (`#83 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/83>`_)

* Removed usage of the "user" module.
  (`#86 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/86>`_)

* Avoids an extra `git update-index` call during startup.


.. _v1.4.3.4:

git-cola v1.4.3.4
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now provide better feedback when `git push` fails.
  (`#69 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/69>`_)

* The Fetch, Push, and Pull dialogs now give better feedback
  when interacting with remotes.  The dialogs are modal and
  a progress dialog is used.

Fixes
-----
* More unicode fixes, again.  It is now possible to have
  unicode branch names, repository paths, home directories, etc.
  This continued the work initiated by Redhat's bugzilla #694806.

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694806

.. _v1.4.3.3:

git-cola v1.4.3.3
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The `git cola` desktop launchers now prompt for a repo
  by default.  This is done by using the new `--prompt`
  flag which tells `git cola` to ignore any git repositories
  in the current directory and prompt for one instead.

Fixes
-----
* More Unicode fixes for repositories and home directories with
  embedded unicode characters.  Thanks to Christian Jann for
  patience and helpful bug reports.

* Fix the 'Clone' button in the startup dialog.

.. _v1.4.3.2:

git-cola v1.4.3.2
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Faster startup time! `git cola` now offloads initialization
  to a background thread so that the GUI appears almost instantly.

* Specialized diff options for p4merge, vimdiff, araxis, emerge,
  and ecmerge in difftool (backported from git.git).

Fixes
-----
* Fix launching commands in the background on Windows
  (e.g. when launching `git difftool`).

* Fix unicode errors when home or repository directories contain
  unicode characters.
  (`#74 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/74>`_)
  (`bz #694806 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694806>`_)

.. _v1.4.3.1:

git-cola v1.4.3.1
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The `cola classic` tool can be now configured to be dockable.
  (`#56 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/56>`_)

* The `cola classic` tool now uses visual sigils to indicate a file's status.
  The idea and icons were provided by Uri Okrent.

* Include the 'Rescan' button in the 'Actions' widget regardless
  of whether inotify is installed.

Packaging
---------
* Fix installation of translations per Fedora
  This incorporates Fedora's fix for the translations path
  which originally appeared in cola-1.4.3-translations.patch.

* Mac OS X git-cola developers can now generate git-cola.app
  application bundles using 'make app-bundle'.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed a stacktrace when trying to use "Get Commit Message Template"
  with an unconfigured "commit.template" git config variable.
  (`bz #67521 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=675721>`_)
  (`#72 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/72>`_)

* Properly raise the main window on Mac OS X.

* Properly handle staging a huge numbers of files at once.

* Speed up 'git config' usage by fixing cola's caching proxy.

* Guard against damaged ~/.cola files.

.. _v1.4.3:

git-cola v1.4.3
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` now has a separate display area
  for displaying commit metadata.  This area will soon
  grow additional functionality such as cherry-picking,
  branching, etc.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed tests from a previous refactoring.

* Guard against 'diff.external' configuration by always
  calling 'git diff' with the '--no-ext-diff' option.
  (`#67 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/67>`_)

* Respect 'gui.diffcontext' so that cola's diff display
  shows the correct number of context lines.

* Raise the GUI so that it is in the foreground on OS X.

Packaging
---------
* We now allow distutils to rewrite cola's shebang line.
  This allows us to run on systems where "which python"
  is Python3k.  This is exposed by setting the `PYTHON`
  Makefile variable to the location of python2.x.

* git-cola.app is now a tiny download because it no longer
  contains Qt and PyQt.  These libraries are provided as a
  separate download.
  (`Link <http://code.google.com/p/git-cola/downloads/list>`_)

.. _v1.4.2.5:

git-cola v1.4.2.5
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Clicking on paths in the status widget copies them into the
  copy/paste buffer for easy middle-clicking into terminals.

* `Ctrl+C` in diff viewer copies the selected diff to the clipboard.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed the disappearing actions buttons on PyQt 4.7.4
  as reported by Arch and Ubuntu 10.10.
  (`#62 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/62>`_)

* Fixed mouse interaction with the status widget where some
  items could not be de-selected.

Packaging
---------
* Removed hard-coded reference to lib/ when calculating Python's
  site-packages directory.

.. _v1.4.2.4:

git-cola v1.4.2.4
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Removed "single-click to (un)stage" in the status view.
  This is a usability improvement since we no longer perform
  different actions depending on where a row is clicked.

* Added ability to create unsigned, annotated tags.

Fixes
-----
* Updated documentation to use `cola.git` instead of `cola.gitcmd`.

.. _v1.4.2.3:

git-cola v1.4.2.3
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Allow un/staging by right-clicking top-level items
  (`#57 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/57>`_)

* Running 'commit' with no staged changes prompts to allow
  staging all files.
  (`#55 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/55>`_)

* Fetch, Push, and Pull are now available via the menus
  (`#58 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/58>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Simplified the actions widget to work around a regression
  in PyQt4 4.7.4.
  (`#62 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/62>`_)

.. _v1.4.2.2:

git-cola v1.4.2.2
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` interaction was made faster.

Fixes
-----
* Added '...' indicators to the buttons for
  'Fetch...', 'Push...', 'Pull...', and 'Stash...'.
  (`#51 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/51>`_)

* Fixed a hang-on-exit bug in the cola-provided
  'ssh-askpass' implementation.

.. _v1.4.2.1:

git-cola v1.4.2.1
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Staging and unstaging is faster.
  (`#48 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/48>`_)

* `git dag` reads history in a background thread.

Portability
-----------
* Added :data:`cola.compat.hashlib` for `Python 2.4` compatibility
* Improved `PyQt 4.1.x` compatibility.

Fixes
-----
* Configured menu actions use ``sh -c`` for Windows portability.


.. _v1.4.2:

git-cola v1.4.2
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Added support for the configurable ``guitool.<tool>.*``
  actions as described in the ``git config`` documentation.
  (`git-config(1) <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>`_)
  (`#44 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/44>`_)

  This makes it possible to add new actions to `git cola`
  by simply editing ``~/.gitconfig``.  This implements the
  same guitool support as `git gui`.

* Introduced a stat cache to speed up `git config` and
  repository status checks.

* Added Alt-key shortcuts to the main `git cola` interface.

* The `Actions` dock widget switches between a horizontal
  and vertical layout when resized.

* We now use ``git diff --submodule`` for submodules
  (used when git >= 1.6.6).

* The context menu for modified submodules includes an option
  to launch `git cola`.
  (`#17 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/17>`_)

* Prefer ``$VISUAL`` over ``$EDITOR`` when both are defined.
  These are used to set a default editor in lieu of `core.editor`
  configuration.

* Force the editor to be ``gvim`` when we see ``vim``.
  This prevents us from launching an editor in the (typically
  unattached) parent terminal and creating zombie editors
  that cannot be easily killed.

* Selections are remembered and restored across updates.
  This makes the `partial-staging` workflow easier since the
  diff view will show the updated diff after staging.

* Show the path to the current repository in a tooltip
  over the commit message editor.
  (`#45 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/45>`_)

* Log internal ``git`` commands when ``GIT_COLA_TRACE`` is defined.
  (`#39 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/39>`_)

Fixes
-----
* Improved backwards compatibility for Python 2.4.

* `Review mode` can now review the current branch; it no longer
  requires you to checkout the branch into which the reviewed
  branch will be merged.

* Guard against `color.ui = always` configuration when using
  `git log` by passing ``--no-color``.

* ``yes`` and ``no`` are now supported as valid booleans
  by the `git config` parser.

* Better defaults are used for `fetch`, `push`, and `pull`..
  (`#43 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/43>`_)

Packaging
---------
* Removed colon (`:`) from the applilcation name on Windows
  (`#41 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/41>`_)

* Fixed bugs with the Windows installer
  (`#40 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/40>`_)

* Added a more standard i18n infrastructure.  The install
  tree now has the common ``share/locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/git-cola.mo``
  layout in use by several projects.

* Started trying to accommodate Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
  in the ``darwin/`` build scripts but our tester is yet to
  report success building a `.app` bundle.

* Replaced use of ``perl`` in Sphinx/documentation Makefile
  with more-portable ``sed`` constructs.  Thanks to
  Stefan Naewe for discovering the portability issues and
  providing msysgit-friendly patches.

.. _v1.4.1.2:

git-cola v1.4.1.2
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* It is now possible to checkout from the index as well
  as from `HEAD`.  This corresponds to the
  `Removed Unstaged Changes` action in the `Repository Status` tool.

* The `remote` dialogs (fetch, push, pull) are now slightly
  larger by default.

* Bookmarks can be selected when `git cola` is run outside of a git repository.

* Added more user documentation.  We now include many links to
  external git resources.

* Added `git dag` to the available tools.
  `git dag` is a node-based DAG history browser.
  It doesn't do much yet, but it's been merged so that we can start
  building and improving upon it.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed a missing ``import`` when showing `right-click` actions
  for unmerged files in the `Repository Status` tool.

* ``git update-index --refresh`` is no longer run every time
  ``git cola version`` is run.

* Don't try to watch non-existent directories when using `inotify`.

* Use ``git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name`` plumbing to find
  the name of the current branch.

Packaging
---------
* The ``Makefile`` will now conditionally include a ``config.mak``
  file located at the root of the project.  This allows for user
  customizations such as changes to the `prefix` variable
  to be stored in a file so that custom settings do not need to
  be specified every time on the command-line.

* The build scripts no longer require a ``.git`` directory to
  generate the ``builtin_version.py`` module.  The release tarballs
  now include a ``version`` file at the root of the project which
  is used in lieu of having the git repository available.
  This allows for ``make clean && make`` to function outside of
  a git repository.

* Added maintainer's ``make dist`` target to the ``Makefile``.

* The built-in `simplejson` and `jsonpickle` libraries can be
  excluded from ``make install`` by specifying the ``standalone=true``
  `make` variable.  For example, ``make standalone=true install``.
  This corresponds to the ``--standalone`` option to ``setup.py``.


.. _v1.4.1.1:

git-cola v1.4.1.1
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now use patience diff by default when it is available via
  `git diff --patience`.

* Allow closing the `cola classic` tool with `Ctrl+W`.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed an unbound variable error in the `push` dialog.

Packaging
---------
* Don't include `simplejson` in MANIFEST.in.

* Update desktop entry to read `Cola Git GUI`.


.. _v1.4.1:

git-cola v1.4.1
===============
This feature release adds two new features directly from
`git cola`'s github issues backlog.  On the developer
front, further work was done towards modularizing the code base.

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Dragging and dropping patches invokes `git am`
  (`#3 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/3>`_)

* A dialog to allow opening or cloning a repository
  is presented when `git cola` is launched outside of a git repository.
  (`#22 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/22>`_)

* Warn when `push` is used to create a new branch
  (`#35 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/35>`_)

* Optimized startup time by removing several calls to `git`.


Portability
-----------
* `git cola` is once again compatible with PyQt 4.3.x.

Developer
---------
* `cola.gitcmds` was added to factor out git command-line utilities

* `cola.gitcfg` was added for interacting with `git config`

* `cola.models.browser` was added to factor out repobrowser data

* Added more tests

* Fix a bug when initializing fonts on Windows
  (`#32 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/32>`_)


.. _v1.4.0.1:

git-cola v1.4.0.1
=================
Fixes
-----
* Keep entries in sorted order in the `cola classic` tool

* Fix staging untracked files
  (`#27 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/27>`_)

  (`#29 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/29>`_)

* Fix a typo when loading merge commit messages
  (`#30 <https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/30>`_)


.. _v1.4.0:

git-cola v1.4.0
===============
This release focuses on a redesign of the git-cola user interface,
a tags interface, and better integration of the `cola classic` tool.
A flexible interface based on configurable docks is used to manage the
various cola widgets.

  and branch.  See the `git` release notes for more information

* Support `open` and `clone` commands on Windows

* Allow saving cola UI layouts

* Re-enabled `double-click-to-stage` for unmerged entries.
