The status tool shows you a quick summary of the
state of the entire project.

Files are categorized similarly to what you'd see when running
`git status <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-status.html>`_
on the command line.

Actions
=======

Clicking the `Staged` folder shows a diffstat for the index.

Clicking the `Modified` folder shows a diffstat for the worktree.

Clicking individual files sends diffs to the `Diff Display`.

Double-clicking individual files adds and removes their content from the index.
