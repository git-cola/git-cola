ACTIVE INGREDIENTS
    # apt-get install git-core python python-qt4

Python 2.4 or newer
    ~ http://python.org/

PyQt 4.1 or newer
    ~ http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download


ADDITIVES
    # apt-get install python-pyinotify

pyinotify >= 0.7.1 enables inotify support on Linux
    ~ http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/


BREWING INSTRUCTIONS
    # apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

Normally you can just do "make install" to install git-cola
in your $HOME directory ($HOME/bin, $HOME/lib, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    # make prefix=/usr install

The "install" target will by default include copies of
simplejson and jsonpickle.  If your system already has these
modules installed then you can specify standalone=true when running "make":

    $ make prefix=/usr standalone=true install


You don't need to install cola to run it.
git-cola is designed to run directly out of its source tree.

    $ make
    $ bin/git-cola


MAC OS X INSTALLTION INSTRUCTIONS

Whether you install cola yourself with "make install" or
use the "git-cola.app" bundle, you will need to install
Qt and PyQt separately.

The easiest way to do this is to use brew.

    ~ http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
    $ brew install git-cola

Once brew has installed git-cola (and its dependencies) you use
git-cola.app or install from source using "make install".
Installing these packages also gives you a PyQt development
environment which can be used for building your own applications
or hacking on cola itself.


WINDOWS INSTALLATION

Download the latest stable Git, Python 2.6, and Py26-PyQt4 installers
    http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
    http://python.org/download/
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

Download the latest git-cola-[version].exe Windows installer
    https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/downloads

Once it's installed you can run it from the Start menu or
from a Git Bash by typing 'cola'.

If you're developing cola on Windows you can run cola out of its source
tree by using the 'win32/cola' shell script.

    $ /c/Python26/python setup.py build
    $ win32/cola

Note: win32/cola assumes you've installed Python in /c/Python26 or /c/Python25.
Adjust accordingly.

You can also add python to your path and run bin/git-cola directly.
