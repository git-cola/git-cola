INSTALLATION
------------

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

If you downloaded a tarball add /path/to/cola/bin to your $PATH.


REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
    http://python.org/
    apt-get install python

PyQt 4.3 or newer
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
    apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools


ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS (optional)

pyinotify (enables inotify support on Linux -- highly recommended)
    http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/
    apt-get install python-pyinotify

simplejson (enables bookmarks)
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson
    apt-get install python-simplejson


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

Normally you can just do "make install" to install git-cola
in your $HOME directory ($HOME/bin, $HOME/lib, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    # make prefix=/usr install

You can also run git-cola without installing it.
It is designed to run directly out of the source tree
This is the best way to run git-cola when you're
modifying the code.

    $ make
    $ bin/git-cola


BUILD ISSUES

Some systems have pyuic4 scripts that are missing the shebang line.
If your version of $(which pyuic4) looks like:

exec python /path/to/pyuic4.py ...

Then simply add this line to the top of the file:

#!/bin/sh

That will fix the build by making pyuic4 a proper shell script.


PYQT4 ISSUES

An older version of pyuic4 generated code that could not be
run by PyQt4.  This problem has been fixed in the latest
versions of PyQt4 (4.4.x), but you might encounter it if
you are not running the latest version of PyQt4.

If you try to run git-cola and see error messages
about "setSortingEnabled(..)" then your pyuic4/PyQt4
version is affected. There's a simple workaround, though:
remove the line of code listed in the traceback and
everything should work fine.


PYUIC4 AND WINDOWS

To build cola on windows you'll need to add the following
shell script to a directory in your path and name it 'pyuic4':

#+-------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
/c/Python25/python.exe \
/c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/uic/pyuic.py "$@"

#+-------------------------------------------------------------


WINDOWS INSTALLATION

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

    http://python.org/download/
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install msysgit:

    http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Install 'dirname.exe':

    Download the Windows binary for dirname:
        http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32

    Copy them to /bin or anywhere in your $PATH.

5) Install simplejson

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson

6) Download cola:

    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

7) Install cola (from a Git Bash):

    cd /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages
    tar xvfz /path/to/cola-*-win32.tar.gz
    mv cola-*-win32 cola

8) Create an executable in your path for bash, cmd.exe, or both:

    echo '/c/Python25/python.exe /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/cola/bin/git-cola' >> /usr/bin/cola
    echo 'c:\\Python25\\python.exe c:\\Python25\\Lib\\site-packages\\cola\\bin\\git-cola' > /c/Windows/System32/cola.bat

This assumes the you have Python/PyQt4 installed in C:/Python25.
If this is not the case simply edit the commands accordingly.

voila, cola on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are greatly appreciated.
