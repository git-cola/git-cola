BREWING INSTRUCTIONS
    # apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

Normally you can just do "make install" to install git-cola
in your $HOME directory ($HOME/bin, $HOME/lib, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    # make prefix=/usr install

You don't need to install cola to run it.
git-cola is designed to run directly out of its source tree.

    $ make
    $ bin/git-cola

Download the latest Cola-[version].exe installer
    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32/

Once it's installed you can run it from the Start menu or
from a Git Bash by typing 'cola'.

If you're developing cola on Windows you can run cola out of its source
tree by using the 'win32/cola' shell script.

    $ /c/Python26/python setup.py build
    $ win32/cola

Note: win32/cola assumes you've installed Python in /c/Python26 or /c/Python25.
Adjust accordingly.  You can also add python to your path and simply bin/git-cola.


ABOUT THE VARIOUS COLA FLAVORS

A cola-*-src tarball does not include any generated files --
it is purely a "source" release and includes everything needed
to generate a cola release.  It is basically an export of git-cola.git.
    ~ http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/.

A cola-*-release tarball contains all of the generated gui files and is
designed to be run as-is.  These are provided for convenience so that
users are not required to have the PyQt4 development tools installed in
order to use cola.
    ~ http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/release/.

A cola-*-win32 tarball contains extra scripts for use on Windows.
It's easier to just use the .exe installer these days, but if you're
paranoid and would rather just download a tarball then that's cool too.
